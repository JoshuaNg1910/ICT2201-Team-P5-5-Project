# Aircon Retailer Workload Management System

In this aircon retailer company, managers have difficulty visualising and allocating jobs for the week, <br>
while staff encounter trouble recording their weekly job assignments and overall workload for the month. <br>
The administrator has difficulty keeping up with the processes of onboarding new staff into the company. <br>
Currently, there is no system to keep track of the number of vans in service and the number of vans sent for servicing. <br>
Therefore, this project aims to provide a web application for the management of staff scheduling, overall workload and vans for the aircon retailer. <br>
This application allows the manager, staff and administrator to have a centralised management system which will help improve work-life balance for everyone in the company.
